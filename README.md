# COVID-19 Statistics #
========================
Our project is a website designed for American domestic travelers interested in COVID-19 statistics, testing centers, and hospitals in the city/ state they are visiting. It was made possible with the integration of three APIs that search the inputted city/ state, then display the total number of people in that area that were tested, positive, negative, and hospitalized as well as deaths. It also shows when the data from the API was last updated.

## User Story ##
=================
AS A human with a respiratory system
I WANT a way to track COVID-19 statistics/ resources across the United    States
SO THAT I can understand other cities and states situations if I want/ need to travel.

### Acceptance Criteria
